# Portfolio Optimization with Physical Stochastic Binary Neuron (SBN) Hardware: A Demonstration of Physical Randomness

## Abstract

This demonstration showcases Nb-nanowire stochastic binary neurons (SBNs) solving real-world optimization problems. We address portfolio optimization --- selecting assets to maximize returns while controlling risk --- to illustrate several key advances:

1. **Validation of Physical Randomness**: Our fabricated Nb-nanowire devices function as true SBNs with genuine physical randomness.

2. **Practical Optimization**: These SBNs can effectively solve complex problems when guided by feedback-based control.

3. **Performance Benchmarking**: We compare our approach against classical methods like simulated annealing, demonstrating the advantages of physical randomness.

## The Optimization Challenge

### Complex Solution Landscapes

The problems we target feature complex landscapes with numerous local minima. The challenge isn't finding perfect solutions --- often impossible --- but finding good solutions quickly and reliably.

Portfolio optimization joins other challenging problems like energy grid optimization, traveling salesman, and staff scheduling. As these problems grow, traditional algorithms often get trapped in suboptimal solutions. Physical randomness offers an advantage by enabling more effective exploration of these complex landscapes.

### Portfolio Optimization Essentials

Portfolio optimization requires selecting assets to balance:

- Maximizing expected returns
- Minimizing investment risk
- Diversifying across uncorrelated assets
- Meeting budget constraints

This represents a real financial challenge that becomes computationally difficult as the number of potential investments increases.

## The Stochastic Binary Neuron (SBN) Advantage

Our approach uses physical stochastic binary neurons (SBNs) with a feedback mechanism that:

1. Maps the problem to a format compatible with our hardware
2. Adjusts the behavior of each SBN based on optimization progress
3. Leverages true physical randomness to navigate complex solution spaces

The physical randomness of our Nb-nanowire SBNs may provide fundamental advantages compared to traditional algorithms, particularly for problems with many local minima where the quality of randomness significantly impacts performance.

This demonstration shows how physical randomness, properly harnessed, can effectively solve complex problems relevant to real-world applications.
