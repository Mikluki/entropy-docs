System Energy vs Solution Space

## 1) Simulated Annealing — “thermal hopping”

**Prompt:**

> A clean, minimalist scientific illustration on a dark background showing simulated annealing. An energy landscape is drawn as a smooth curve with multiple local minima. A single particle moves step-by-step with short random jumps, occasionally moving uphill. Most transitions stay within a local basin, with the particle becoming trapped in a local minimum. Warm color accents (e.g. orange or red) indicate thermal randomness. Simple arrows show small probabilistic hops. No equations, no text labels except “Simulated Annealing”. Presentation-ready, modern, flat design.

**Visual message:** slow exploration, local trapping, thermal noise.

## 2) Quantum Annealing — “tunneling through barriers”

**Prompt:**

> A clean, minimalist scientific illustration on a dark background showing quantum annealing. An energy landscape with tall barriers and multiple minima is drawn. A particle transitions smoothly through energy barriers via curved or dashed paths representing quantum tunneling rather than climbing over them. Cool color accents (e.g. cyan or green) indicate tunneling. Motion appears smooth and non-classical. No equations, minimal labels, only “Quantum Annealing”. Modern, high-contrast, presentation-style illustration.

**Visual message:** barrier penetration, non-classical transitions.

## 3) Probabilistic Annealing / p-bits — “controlled stochastic jumps”

**Prompt:**

> A clean, modern scientific illustration on a dark background showing probabilistic annealing with p-bits. An energy landscape is drawn with several minima. A particle makes discrete stochastic jumps of varying length, guided by controllable probability. Some jumps cross barriers, others explore locally. A nearby control element emits probabilistic signals influencing the jumps. Bright accent color (e.g. magenta or violet) highlights controllable randomness. Minimal labels, flat design, presentation-ready.

**Visual message:** stochastic but directed exploration, hardware-controlled randomness.

## Styling guidance (important for consistency)

When generating:

- Use **the same background color** as your slides
- Use **one accent color per method**
- Keep **line weight identical** across all three
- Avoid gradients inside the landscape itself (flat curves read better on slides)

---

## How this improves the slide

- Visually aligns with your hardware slides
- Makes p-bits feel like a **distinct third paradigm**, not a variant footnote
- Removes “paper screenshot” aesthetics entirely

If you want next, I can:

- Help you **reword the table** to match the new visuals, or
- Help compress this into **two figures instead of three** without losing meaning.
