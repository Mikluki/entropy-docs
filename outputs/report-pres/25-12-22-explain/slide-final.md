## Final slide — Takeaways & next steps

### Title (active, calm)

**Hardware stochastic compute: what we showed**

---

### Core takeaways (4 bullets, factual)

- **Physical randomness generated directly in hardware**
  32 independent, room-temperature silicon noise sources

- **Stochastic decisions accelerated, algorithms unchanged**
  Deterministic logic stays in software; randomness moves to hardware

- **Low-latency, controllable sampling**
  Hardware access avoids software and network overhead

- **Scales naturally to multi-bit stochastic systems**
  Parallel p-bits exposed directly to SoC / FPGA fabric

---

### Forward-looking block (small, not hype)

**Next steps**

- On-device stochastic kernels on Zynq
- Tighter coupling between p-bits and optimization loops
- Scaling channel count and integration depth

Keep this visually lighter than the takeaways.

### Closing line (boxed, optional)

> **Hardware makes stochastic optimization practical at scale.**

Short. Declarative. No adjectives.

---

### What this slide does well

- Summarizes **everything already demonstrated**
- Does not introduce new claims
- Leaves room for questions and discussion
- Feels like an _engineering conclusion_, not a pitch deck

---

### One-sentence closing narration (for you)

“We didn’t change algorithms — we removed latency where randomness lives.”

If you want, I can:

- Tune this to be **more conservative or more visionary**, or
- Add a **one-line acknowledgments / reference footer** if this is a formal talk.
